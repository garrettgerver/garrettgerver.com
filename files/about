Hello. My name is Garrett Gerver--a second-year Computer Science student attending the
University of Cincinnati. I first learned how to code with Java in my highschool's 
robotics team, but really fell in love with coding a few years later doing a data-science
project in Python with a friend. This inflatuation with the flow of data and the ability
to extract insights from it is what set me on my Computer Science journey. Because of
this, I am most interested in data-engineering, data science, and backend developer roles
as they complement my interests in the field and are what I find most enjoyable. Feel free
to browse this webpage to learn more about me and my work.
