This is a little Python script that uses Beautiful Soup and Requests to parse Yahoo
Finance articles about a stock and run the articles through a pretrained LLM model
specialized in financial sentiment analysis to get a sentiment score per article. 
This project, while fun to make, lacks a standardized sentiment score that makes
any of the output meaningful, which I hope to get to in the future. Nevertheless,
I believe this is a well-structured project that shows my comfort in the data-science
field.
